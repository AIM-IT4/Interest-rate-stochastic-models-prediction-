# Interest Rate Predictions using Monte Carlo Simulations

This project uses various interest rate stochastic models to simulate potential future paths for interest rates. 
The models used include Vasicek, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR), Hull-White, and an approximated version of Black-Derman-Toy (BDT).

## Results:

- Predicted Interest Rates at the end of Next Month:
  - Vasicek: 3.027% ± 0.313%
  - CIR: 3.056% ± 0.097%
  - Hull-White: 3.031% ± 0.298%
  - BDT (Approximated): 3.062% ± 0.265%
